# Image Classification CNN

This is a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. The dataset used in this notebook can be found in the dataset directory.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow, Keras
- Jupyter Notebook
## Usage

To use this notebook, open it with Jupyter Notebook and run each cell in order.

The notebook is divided into several parts:

1) Data preprocessing: This part involves data augmentation and scaling.
2) Building the CNN: This part involves defining the CNN architecture.
3) Training the CNN: This part involves compiling and fitting the CNN to the training data.
4) Making a single prediction: This part involves loading a single image and making a prediction.
## Dataset

The dataset consists of two folders:

training_set: contains 8000 images of cats and dogs for training the CNN.
test_set: contains 2000 images of cats and dogs for evaluating the performance of the CNN.
## Result

The CNN achieves an accuracy of over 80% on the test set.
